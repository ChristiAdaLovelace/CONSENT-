Name of Procedure: LASIK Surgery  
Date of Procedure: 08/15/2023  
Practitioner's Name: Dr. Sarah Lee  
Practitioner's Qualifications: Board-certified ophthalmologist  
Procedure Description: LASIK, or Laser Assisted Substrate Keratectomy, is a surgical intervention that employs a laser to modify the cornea, the transparent layer of the eye responsible for vision. This procedure can enhance visual acuity, alleviate astigmatism, and diminish nearsightedness.

**PROCEDURE DETAILS**
______________________________

Name of Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization  
Date of Procedure: 02/23/2022  
Procedure Description: A minimally invasive diagnostic method for identifying arterial blockages in the heart's blood supply involves the insertion of a slender, flexible tube through the wrist or groin region. This tube, known as a catheter, is then guided through the blood vessels to the heart, where it is equipped with a contrast agent that produces a clear image on an X-ray.  

______________________________
**RISKS & EXPECTED OUTCOMES**
______________________________

Possible Risks: Potential complications may encompass bleeding, infection, hypersensitivity to the contrast agent, and arterial or cardiac damage. Additionally, there is a risk of myocardial infarction or cerebral vasculature damage during the procedure.  
Expected Outcomes: Cardiac catheterization is a diagnostic procedure that can identify potential blockages in the arteries that may be causing symptoms such as chest pain. If blockages are detected, they can be addressed through the use of medications or surgical interventions like angioplasty or bypass surgery.
